# About auto-exposures <Lifecycle status='beta' />

As a data team, it’s critical that you have context into the downstream use cases and users of your data products. Auto-exposures integrates natively with Tableau (Power BI coming soon) and auto-generates downstream lineage in dbt Explorer for a richer experience.

Auto-exposures help data teams optimize their efficiency and ensure data quality by:

- Helping users understand how their models are used in downstream analytics tools to inform investments and reduce incidents — ultimately building trust and confidence in data products.
- Importing and auto-generating exposures based on Tableau dashboards, with user-defined curation.
- Enabling the active exposure work to run models based on when exposures are updated or need to be updated, improving timeliness and reducing costs.

For more info on how to set up auto-exposures, prerequisites, and more &mdash; refer to [Configure auto-exposures in dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud-integrations/configure-auto-exposures)
